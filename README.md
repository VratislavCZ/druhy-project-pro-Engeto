# TIC TAC TOE

## This is second project for Engeto Online Python Akademie

### Functions on project

The application contains a module named play_board, that contains two functions helping_board() and printing_board() for displaying the game board.

There are other functions such as:

 Function to print the game board

 Function to clear the console

 Action for create players

 Function for player's move

 Main game loop

 Function to check for a win, containing also functions for checking rows, columns, and diagonals.

 Function to check for a full board

 For now, I'm not using docstrings in functions because they make the code less clear to me and I find it difficult to navigate through them.
